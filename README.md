##  Project Overview:

The **Ola Data Analyst Project** is a comprehensive business analytics case study focusing on the ride-hailing industry, specifically Ola’s operational data. This project leverages tools such as **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI** to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize data for actionable business insights.

The goal was to analyze key aspects of Ola’s business, including ride demand trends, driver performance, pricing strategies, cancellation patterns, and customer behavior. The final output includes interactive Power BI dashboards that present these insights in an accessible format for decision-making.

##  Project Process:

The project was developed in a **structured five-phase approach**:

1. **Requirement Gathering & Project Planning:**

   * Defined objectives and key metrics for analysis.
   * Identified data sources (Ola ride data, customer feedback, driver records).

2. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**

   * Collected datasets in CSV/Excel format.
   * Cleaned and structured the data using **Excel** and **SQL** (handling missing values, duplicates, formatting).

3. **Data Analysis & Exploration:**

   * Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL queries and Excel functions.
   * Identified trends, anomalies, and patterns.

4. **Visualization & Insights:**

   * Built interactive **Power BI Dashboards**:

     * **Overall Performance**: Total bookings, successful vs. cancelled rides, daily trends.
     * **Vehicle Type**: Revenue, distance covered, success rates per vehicle.
     * **Revenue**: Earnings breakdown by ride category.
     * **Cancellations**: Reasons, frequencies, and impact.
     * **Ratings**: Customer feedback across services.

5. **Documentation & Final Report Preparation:**

   * Compiled all project phases into a detailed report, including **screenshots of dashboards**, **SQL queries**, and **methodology explanations**.
   * Focused on clear storytelling for **data-driven decision-making**.
   * Submitted the final report for review and evaluation.

##  Tools & Technologies Used:

* **SQL** – Data extraction and querying.
* **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and preliminary analysis.
* **Power BI** – Dashboard development and data visualization.

---

##  Key Insights from the Project:

* Identified peak booking hours and high-demand locations.
* Analyzed reasons for ride cancellations, highlighting driver-side issues as a key area for improvement.
* Evaluated pricing trends, fare distributions, and revenue patterns.
* Assessed driver performance based on ratings, cancellations, and trip completion rates.
* Created actionable recommendations for improving Ola’s service efficiency and customer satisfaction.
